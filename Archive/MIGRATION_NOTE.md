# Archive Directory

This directory contains legacy implementations and backups from the LearnKeys project migration.

## Contents

### `legacy-udp-implementation/`
Contains the original UDP-based implementation that was in the root directory:
- `Core/UDPKeyTracker.swift` - Original UDP key tracking implementation
- `Core/AnimationController.swift` - Legacy animation controller (4.3KB)
- `Utils/LogManager.swift` - Legacy log manager (2.6KB)

### Other Archives
- `LearnKeys-Original-Backup/` - Complete backup of original project structure
- `2024-12-19-TCP-Implementation/` - Previous TCP implementation attempts

## Migration Summary

**Date**: May 26, 2025

**Action**: Moved working TCP implementation from `LearnKeys/` subdirectory to root level

**Reason**: The TCP implementation in the subdirectory was complete and production-ready, solving the Kanata fork construct issues on macOS. The root-level UDP implementation was legacy code that needed to be archived.

## Current Active Implementation

The root directory now contains the complete, working TCP-based LearnKeys system with:
- ✅ Kanata fork issue #1641 resolved
- ✅ Complete press/release event tracking
- ✅ Production-ready TCP communication on port 6790
- ✅ Enhanced Swift architecture with comprehensive logging
- ✅ Full test suite and documentation

## Recovery

If you need to restore any legacy code, all original implementations are preserved in this Archive directory.
